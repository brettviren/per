#+title: Some Personal Programs

This packages collects some programs I install to my personal accounts.

Clone and ~cd~ to the ~per/~ source and

#+begin_example
./install.sh
#+end_example
 
For now, this is pretty dumb.
- [ ] Replace the brute force script with a DAG runner (waf/make/snakemake/???)
